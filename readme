Producer Consumer program with Semaphores and Shared Memory developped for the Operating Systems course in University of Athens.

The goal of this program is for the Producers to fetch random lines from a text file and pass it to the Consumer to capitalize it.
There are many Producers but only one Consumer acting as the parent process. There are two parts of shared memory that the different 
processes use and there are two semaphores to synchronize access to the shared memory.

The processes communicate through the shared memory. The child processes read from a text file and then pass it through the shared 
memory to the parent process. The parent capitalizes it and saves it again in the shared memory. When the loops specified by the user
have been completed the processes quit and then the master process prints the results.
